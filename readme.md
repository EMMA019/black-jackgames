♠️ BlackJack Casino AI (Production Ready)This is a scalable, real-time Blackjack game built with Python, Flask, SocketIO, and Redis. It features an AI opponent with three difficulty levels and is built on a robust architecture designed for production deployment.This project was initially designed and generated by Evo-Coder and refined through iterative debugging.✨ Key FeaturesReal-time Gameplay: Uses WebSocket (Flask-SocketIO) to synchronize game state between the server and clients instantly.Scalable Session Management: Uses Redis as the session store instead of traditional Flask sessions or in-memory dictionaries. This allows the application to be scaled across multiple processes (e.g., Gunicorn workers) while maintaining user state.AI Opponent: Play against an AI with three distinct difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.Persistent Balance: Player balances are persistently stored in an SQL database (SQLite/PostgreSQL) via SQLAlchemy.Asynchronous Task Handling: Uses eventlet to spawn background tasks for AI and Dealer turns, ensuring the player's UI is never blocked.🛠️ Tech StackBackendPython 3.10+Flask: Core web application framework.Flask-SocketIO: Real-time bidirectional communication (WebSocket).Redis: Scalable session storage for active GameSession objects.Flask-SQLAlchemy: Persistent storage for user data (e.g., balance).Eventlet / Gunicorn: Asynchronous WSGI server for production.python-dotenv: Management of environment variables (from .env).FrontendHTML5CSS3: Custom casino-themed styling (based on frontend\_spec.md).JavaScript (ES6+): Socket.IO client for state-driven UI updates.📂 Project Structureblackjack/

🚀 Setup and Launch Guide1. PrerequisitesPython 3.10 or newer.Redis Server: Must be installed and running.(For Windows, using WSL/Ubuntu is recommended: sudo apt install redis-server)2. InstallationClone the repositorygit clone \[your-repo-url]

cd blackjack

Create and activate a Python virtual environmentpython -m venv venv

\# On Windows

.\\venv\\Scripts\\activate

\# On macOS / Linux

source venv/bin/activate

Install all required librariespip install -r requirements.txt

Set up environment variablesCopy the example file to create your local environment file.# On Windows

copy .env.example .env

\# On macOS / Linux

cp .env.example .env

Now, edit the .env file and set your SECRET\_KEY.Important: If you encounter connection errors (like Lookup timed out on Windows), change the REDIS\_URL from localhost to the direct IP address:# .env file

REDIS\_URL='redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0'

3\. Launching the Application(Terminal 1) Start your Redis ServerIf it's not already running, start Redis.# Example for WSL (Ubuntu)

sudo service redis-server start

(Terminal 2) Start the Web ServerIn the project's root directory (where wsgi.py is located), run the wsgi.py file.python wsgi.py

You should see the following output if successful:\[INFO] wsgi: Game blueprint registered successfully.

\[INFO] wsgi: Starting Eventlet WSGI server for local development...

\[INFO] wsgi: SocketIO server starting on 0.0.0.0:5000

(12345) wsgi starting up on \[http://0.0.0.0:5000](http://0.0.0.0:5000)
